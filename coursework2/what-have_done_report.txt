Data cleaning process:
In the purpose columns, there was: 1 row with written 'ather', instead
Other  - 2 rows with written Radio/Tv instead radio/tv (has been merged to 
radio/tv).

Alwasy in the purpose column:
there are 3 different types of purposes: business, busness, a busines;
Allows of them clearly refers to the same purpose: business. 
Always in the pupose columns

there was 1 Eduction purposes, that defintely belogs to the education 
category (that has other 49 records).

There are different outliers in the age colums. 
The age range goes from -40 to 340 and this shows the clear 
present of outliers. 

There are 3 records where the age is between 80 and 340
And 8 records where the age is between -35 and 6;
All these outliers age has been set to 1;


Clumn job: there were 2 'yes', that has been updated to' skilled'
if value > 150:
     return 1
else:
     return value

Cosa devo fare:
Applicare:
Classification, regression,a ssociation e algorithm di clustering
e destrifere il pattenrs, in modo dare capire quali clienti sono piu'\
sicuri per dare il prestito. 


These patterns should be
represented by rules (about 6 rules from each of the algorithms used),
supported by statistical information, such as accuracy and coverage, if
possible.

ID3 and Apriori only accept nominal values
â€“ Linear Regression only accepts numeric values

8)  Why does OneR perform so badly?
j48:
 
------Da fare
- check if uniqueness has been respected: uniquess significa che tutti i record devono rifererire ad un singolo cliente. 
	Controllare in genere nome o id per esempio. 

Per ogni prova: in Weka, nella sezione classify, prova tutte  
tre training set, Ceross validation e
percentage split. 
Use LinearRegression and SimpleLinearRegression 
l: Use Logistic and SimpleLogistic to analyse the .arff

ZeroR algorithm : what is used for?


|   credit_history = delayed previously: good (18.0/3.0)
|   credit_history = critical/other existing credit: good (33.0/9.0)
|   credit_history = no credits/all paid: bad (9.0/4.0)
|   credit_history = all paid: bad (6.0/2.0)
